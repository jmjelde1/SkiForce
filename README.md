# SkiForce
This app makes a day on the hill more engaging by letting users look at insightful data about their run. 
By utilizing Swift and SwiftUI, for each run the user does on 
the hill they are given information on how many turns they did, average and maximum G-force, average and top speed, jump time,
and length as well as total vertical descent and other GPS related metrics. The app also has a built-in machine learning model that 
predicts ski type based on the accelerometer data collected while skiing.
